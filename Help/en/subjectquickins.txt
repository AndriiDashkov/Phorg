Quick insert</b><br>
______________
<br><br>



&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There is another, faster possibility to insert a subject into&nbsp; an image in comparison&nbsp; with &nbsp;using<br>
the Images->Edit menu item. The subjects popup menu has the following item "Insert selected subject". <br>
Just &nbsp;select the&nbsp; images &nbsp;(use Shift for&nbsp; multi-selection)&nbsp; on the&nbsp; main &nbsp;view panel &nbsp;and the subject &nbsp;you <br> 
need on &nbsp;the list of subjects. Then use&nbsp; the mentioned&nbsp; item to insert&nbsp; the &nbsp;selected subject &nbsp;into all the  <br>
selected images.

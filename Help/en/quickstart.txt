<b>Quick start</b><br>
_____________
<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You should take the following simple steps to start the software quickly : <br><br>
<b>
1) Change localization (internationalization)</b> <br>
Use the menu  Instruments -> Settings -> Localization. Then restart the application.
<br><br><b>
2) Click the button "New album" on the main toolbar<br><br>

3) Fill in the fields of the dialog window in order to create a new album:
</b><br><br>

- give a name to your album;<br><br>
- set the date of the album creation;<br><br>

- as a newly created album will be the first, there is no need to use a parent album option, the first <br>
created  album is always on the top of the tree; this album can be reparented  later, when there is a <br>
 more complicated structure of albums;<br><br>

- do not touch the 'album folder' option for the first album, this is not essential in the begining;<br><br>
- edit the comments field, if you want;<br><br>
- click 'Ok'.<br><br>
<b>
4) Now your album is in the list of albums. 
</b><br>
The label on the top of the main view panel informs that the album is current now, and has no <br>
images. <br><br>
- click the right button of the mouse on the empty area of the main view panel to open a popup  menu. <br><br>
- choose the item 'Add group of images' in the menu.<br><br>
- in the dialog window choose the folder with images which you would like to add to the current album.<br>
Pay attention that the application may search for images in all included folders.<br><br>
- leave the option 'add as links' in the switched on state.<br><br>
- click 'Ok'.<br><br>
<b>
5) The process of loading will start.<br>
</b>
It can take some time (if there are a lot of images in the chosen folder).

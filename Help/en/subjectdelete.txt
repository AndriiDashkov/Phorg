Delete subject</b><br>
______________
<br><br>


&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To delete the subject use menu Subjects -> Delete.<br>
The&nbsp; operation &nbsp; is carried out&nbsp;  with currently &nbsp; selected subjects in the subjects&nbsp;  table (list).There is <br>
one &nbsp;problem about &nbsp;subjects deletion: a&nbsp; subject&nbsp; can &nbsp;be &nbsp;used  in&nbsp; the&nbsp; existing &nbsp;albums. So &nbsp;the<br> 
dialog window offers some options in this situation.  
<br><br>
- Clear subjects links from the selected albums
<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sometimes there is a need to remove a subject&nbsp; from all the images in a certain album. The <br> 
delete operation with this option clears links to &nbsp;the subject from all &nbsp;the &nbsp;images in the &nbsp;album, &nbsp;but <br>
subjects themselves are not deleted from the subjects list.
<br><br>
- Clear subjects links from all the albums and delete the subject itself
<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This &nbsp;option &nbsp;helps &nbsp;to delete&nbsp; the &nbsp;selected&nbsp; subject&nbsp; at &nbsp;all. The &nbsp;operation with this &nbsp;option <br> 
clears &nbsp;the links &nbsp;from &nbsp;ALL albums &nbsp;and &nbsp;then deletes &nbsp;the &nbsp;subject from &nbsp;the &nbsp;list. This &nbsp;is the &nbsp;only <br> 
option that allows to remove the subject at &nbsp;all, because &nbsp;images &nbsp; can't &nbsp;have links to &nbsp;the &nbsp;subject <br>
which doesn't exist, that is why links for the selected subject are removed from all the albums.

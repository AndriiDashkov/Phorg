Delete image</b><br>
____________
<br><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This operation can delete an image from an album using the following options:
<br><br>
- delete the image from the current album
<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The image will be removed from the current loaded album only.
<br><br>
- delete the image from all the albums
<br><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  The links to the image&nbsp; will be removed from &nbsp;all albums (the same&nbsp; image can be inserted<br> 
into different albums as a link). The image will be searched for using a path to its physical&nbsp; location<br> 
in the file system during this operation.
<br><br>
- without deleting images from the disk
<br><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In this &nbsp;case only &nbsp;links to&nbsp; this &nbsp;image (images) &nbsp;will &nbsp;be removed&nbsp; from an album or albums<br> 
(it depends on previous options). The files themselves will be safe in the file system.
<br><br>
- with deleting the images from the disk 
<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In this case image files  will be physically removed from the file system.<br><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Take into account &nbsp;that the delete &nbsp;operation allows multiremoving: use the&nbsp;mouse &nbsp;click with <br>
Shift  &nbsp;to  &nbsp;select more &nbsp; than &nbsp;one image  &nbsp;and &nbsp;then use &nbsp; the  &nbsp;operation: &nbsp;all &nbsp;selected&nbsp; images will&nbsp; be<br> 
removed.

<b>Common view of the application </b><br>
_________________________________
<br><br>

The application has four main windows:<br><br>

<b>
- the albums tree 
</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This &nbsp;window contains &nbsp;the list &nbsp;of &nbsp;all albums in &nbsp;the tree &nbsp;view. All &nbsp;operations for this &nbsp;tree are <br> 
available through the menu 'Album' or the &nbsp;context &nbsp;menu. This &nbsp;window reflects the &nbsp;interdependencies <br>
between albums in the form of 'parent-child'.
<br><br>
<b>
- Main view panel
</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This main panel contains all the images for one selected and &nbsp;loaded album. This window is the<br> 
 main place for the user to work with &nbsp;images. The content of &nbsp;the main&nbsp; view panel can be &nbsp;changed&nbsp; by <br>
loading another album, filter operation,sorting, edit , delete , move operations and so on.
<br><br>  
<b>
- List of images
</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;List of images in &nbsp;the form of a table is &nbsp;intended to help the user to go through the &nbsp;images the <br> 
quicker&nbsp; when the image&nbsp; itself is not essential. This table is secondary in &nbsp;comparison with the&nbsp; main <br>
view panel.
<br><br>
<b>
- List of subjects
</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This window &nbsp;contains all the subjects &nbsp;created by user in the form of a &nbsp;table. All the edit, move  <br>
and add operations are supported. The subject is a term that can help the user to build the cross-album 
<br>links.
<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The place &nbsp;and visibility &nbsp;of &nbsp;all these windows can &nbsp;be switched via &nbsp;the 'Window' &nbsp;menu. Some <br>
operations are dependent on the state of windows pairs. Here are some of them:
<br><br>
- selecting (or finding) the image which is in the&nbsp; main view panel by the &nbsp;double click on the item &nbsp;in the<br>
list of images;<br><br> 
- loading images for the selected  album to the  main view panel using the item from the context menu in <br>
the list of album tree;<br><br>
- changing the icon of the album via the menu item in the context menu of the main view panel;<br><br>
- fast inserting of currently selected (in the list of subjects) subject into the images selected in the main <br>
view panel. <br><br>

<b>Find</b><br>
______
<br><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Use this operation to search for an album in the tree. The dialog has only one field  which<br> 
 accepts the name of the &nbsp;album. There is no need to enter the full name; when&nbsp; entered symbols <br>
coincide with some albums, you can &nbsp;find them just &nbsp;pushing the button “Find” some times  - the <br>
selection will move to the next found album.
